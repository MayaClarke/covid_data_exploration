# Covid-19 Data Exploration
## Task
* In this project, I explored a dataset on COVID-19 deaths around the world from 2020 to the present. I used MSSQL to execute queries, which included joins, CTE's, temp tables, windows functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types.
## Dataset
* Covid-19 data from 1 Jan 2020 to May 2022 from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
## Tools
* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 for data analysis - [SQL scripts](https://github.com/MayaClarke/covid_data_exploration/blob/main/covid_data_exploration.sql)
* Tableau for data visualisation - [View dashboard](url)
