In this project, I explored a dataset on COVID-19 deaths around the world from 2020 to the present. I used BigQuery to execute queries, which included joins, CTE's, temp tables, windows functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types.
The dataset used for this analysis is: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
